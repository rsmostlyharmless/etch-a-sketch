# etch-a-sketch

For the Javascript on the project I followed a video on YouTube by Coding With Rob and then made a few small adjustments to suit the style page and game.

I'm still finding Javascript a bit confusing. A lot of information has been placed in my head but I am still not sure how to place that information into script. more projects to be done to counter this.

This may get a bit repetative but I still love using the painting by my girlfriend (Amy Lightowlers) as by background.
